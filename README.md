# windows11-welcome-screen-customizer
 A Windows 11 utility that lets you customize the initial login/welcome screen background - the screen you see when starting your PC. Unlike the built-in Windows Settings which only changes the lock screen, this tool specifically modifies the welcome screen through registry modifications.
